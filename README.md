Project: Detection of Diabetes  using logistic regression
Diabetes is one of the most common diseases worldwide. And also considered as the deadliest and chronic disease which is caused due to an increase in the blood sugar level and other parameters. 
Prediction of diabetes in last stage is a very complex task, as several environmental factors are responsible for it. 
There are certain medical diagnosis systems which are helpful for physicians to know whether a patient is diabetes or not.
Many Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been utilized in predicting diabetes in the last couple of years. 

Therefore Machine Learning classification Algorithm namely logistic regression is used in this experiment to detect diabetes at an early stage.
